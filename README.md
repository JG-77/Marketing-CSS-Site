## Description
The Horiseon Web Marketing site has received an update with the same great look! The site now meets accessibility standards and has improved HTML and CSS semantic structure. 

### Notes
Changes were made to the semantic format of the HTML file to make the file structure easier to understand. Most <div> elements were changed to fit the semantic style format, such as with the header, navbar, side bar, and sections. In addition, unnecesary element tags such as </img> were removed, and comments were added to identify major parts of the webpage for a cleaner look. In the original HTML file, the "search engine optimization" navigation tag did not properly function until an id selector was added to its card section like its counterparts.
