## Description
The Horiseon Web Marketing site has received an update with the same great look! The site now meets accessibility standards and has improved HTML and CSS semantic structure. The site now provides a better UI and functionality. Major changes to the site and code structure can be observed in Notes section below or in the project repository.

### Notes
Changes were made to the semantic format of the HTML file to make the file structure easier to understand. Most "div" elements were changed to fit the semantic HTML format, such as with the header, navbar, side bar, and sections. In addition, unnecesary element tags such as the closing "img" tag were removed, and comments were added to identify major parts of the webpage for a cleaner look. The "search engine optimization" navigation tag did not properly function until an id selector was added to its card section like its counterparts.

The CSS file was mainly reorganized to group styling selectors based on the sections they were in. Comments were added to identify groups styling selectors or to describe the type of styling done to that element.
